## Aim 3

**BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES:** People with dementia (PWD) take medications that may be unnecessary or harmful. This is a problem that can be addressed through deprescribing, but it is unclear if PWD would be willing to do this. Our goal was to investigate attitudes towards deprescribing among PWD.

**DESIGN:** Cross-sectional analysis.

**SETTING & PARTICIPANTS:** 439 PWD (possible or probable) aged â‰¥65 years who completed the Medications Attitudes module of the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) in 2016. Proxies provided responses when a participant was unable to respond due to health or cognitive problems.
