# Introduction
This aim explores attitudes of community-dwelling older adults with dementia and their caregivers' attitude toward medications and their willingness to deprescribe. Cohort eligibility requirements were having a completed NHATS Round 6 MA module and were aged 65 or older in that year. We merged these data with the NHATS dementia classifcations data and NHATS Early Life files from Rounds 1 and 5.
